# jigglehelper
Software is in super early stages and was basically thrown together to help myself work on qc files that include valves jigglebones. Feel free to help make it better with push requests.

## quick-guide
* Write the name of your jigglebones in a list in the textbox and hit generate qc to clipboard.
* Right-click the textbox to the left to open up a menu that lets you quickly generate a list of bones based on incremental names.
